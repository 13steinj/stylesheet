# /r/Agario's CSS

This repository holds [/r/Agario](https://www.reddit.com/r/agario)'s Unminified CSS, and a script to convert it to "reddit form". In otherwords, to make it automatically compatible with reddit, and minify it. Eventually, it will be expanded so that the additional script will have it's own repository, but for now, that's what we got.
